                Full Stack Engineer Intern
            </h1>
            <p>I am a computer science student at the University of Washington. 
                I am a current full-stack engineer at codepath as well as a part-time physics researcher doing
                simulation analysis using Python. I am open to more software development internships and
                research related to computer science or life science.

        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I found my love for computers
            through coding clubs. I aspire to become a software engineer that will be able to program
            medical machinery. I would like to be on the forefront of the medical tech world.
            I would love to utilize my programming skills to find much-needed solutions to problems that
            involve humans at the cellular level. As someone who has a family history of suffering from
            diabetes, cancer, and high blood pressure, I would like to join the fight and commit to
            researching solutions to ease the pain of chronic diseases. Before joining the fight, I am
            increasing my knowledge by taking fundamental courses such as the Intro to Data Science course
            (CSE180). The professor and TAs talk about how to utilize data to create solutions. I learned that
            data science can be used to help cancer patients in many ways like sorting through a large
            amount of information and connecting medical professionals with the most relevant information
            that will be used to design disease treatments.

                            In the game of hangman, one player (in this case, a computer) chooses a word that the other player (the user) must guess. The guesser guesses individual letters until either the entire word is revealed (in which case the guesser wins) or a certain number of wrong letters are guessed (in which case the guesser loses).
